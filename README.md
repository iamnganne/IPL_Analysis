**#IPL Analysis Project with Apache Spark and Databricks**

**Overview**
This project demonstrates the use of Apache Spark on Databricks to analyze and process large-scale IPL cricket data. The pipeline is designed for efficient data loading, preprocessing, and in-depth analysis, with a focus on performance optimization and data visualization.

**Features**
+ Data Ingestion: Load IPL datasets from AWS S3 into Databricks.
+ Schema Design: Structured data into multiple tables such as matches, players, and ball-by-ball details.

**Data Preprocessing**
+ Filtered valid deliveries.
+ Calculated cumulative scores.
+ Used Spark Window Functions for advanced data categorization.

**Data Analysis**
+ Assessed the impact of winning coin tosses on match outcomes.
+ Identified the highest-scoring players.

**Performance Optimization**
+ Utilized Spark SQL for faster queries.
+ Leveraged Databricks for distributed processing and efficient storage.
  
**Technologies Used**
+ Apache Spark: For distributed data processing and analytics.
+ Databricks: Cloud-based platform for scalable data engineering and analytics.
+ AWS S3: Data storage and retrieval.
+ PySpark: For data manipulation and processing.

Setup Instructions
+ Upload Data to S3: Store IPL datasets in an S3 bucket.
+ Create a Databricks Cluster: Set up a Databricks cluster with Apache Spark runtime.
+ Connect to S3: Configure Databricks to read data from your S3 bucket.
+ Run the Notebook: Execute the provided PySpark notebook for data ingestion, processing, and analysis.
